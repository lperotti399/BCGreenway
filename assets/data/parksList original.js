      "   Pennock Memorial Field is a small, 10-acre park west of Kennett Square Borough.  It is within walking distance of the Borough, however it is not linked to the sidewalk grid so pedestrian access is limited.  The Park contains two softball fields, some open land, play equipment, a snack shed, bathrooms, and a parking area.  The two fields are used for league play, but can be used for 'pick-up' games or general public use when not in use by leagues.  Future plans include developing a walking trail and planting shade trees in the Park.",

The preserve has been designated as a Pennsylvania Wild Plant Sanctuary by PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources due in part to the plant life foudn in the Unionville Barrens and is included as part of Audubon's important Bird Area, where birds such as Indigo Bunting and Wood Sparrows, among others, might be spotted.  There are 13 miles of unpaved trailes within the preserve.  Kayaking and canoeing is permitted (call for information), as is horseback riding on designated trailes, though trailers are not permitted.  Dogs are welcome but must be leashed at all times.  A children's NaturePlayGround can be found near the Lenfest Center that allows children to explore the natural landscape.",
